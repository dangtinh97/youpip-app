                                            and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of

                                            unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent

                                            may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to
                                            the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the
